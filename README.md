Utilized an Uber dataset containing information on Uber trips, including details such as start and stop locations, distances traveled, and the purpose of each trip. The dataset was loaded into a pandas DataFrame, and an initial exploration revealed the need for data cleaning. Addressed issues such as missing or inconsistent data, ensuring numerical consistency for analysis.

During the cleaning process, I converted date and time columns to the appropriate datetime format, and I handled missing or inconsistent entries in columns like 'MILES' and 'PURPOSE'. 
Additionally, I encountered challenges in visualizing the data effectively, especially with numerous categorical variables. To address this, I employed various visualization techniques,involving Python Libraries like matplotlib,seaborn, plotly, etc to create visuals like boxplots, scatterplots, and pie charts, in order to extract meaningful insights. With a more vast dataset, future research objectives could be related to customer segmentation, weather conditions impact, surge pricing and more.
