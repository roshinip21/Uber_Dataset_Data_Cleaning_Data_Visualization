Utilized an Uber dataset obtained from Stack Overflow containing information on Uber trips, including details such as start and stop locations, distances traveled, and the purpose of each trip. The dataset was loaded into a pandas DataFrame, and an initial exploration revealed the need for data cleaning. We addressed issues such as missing or inconsistent data, ensuring numerical consistency for analysis.

During the cleaning process, I converted date and time columns to the appropriate datetime format, and I handled missing or inconsistent entries in columns like 'MILES' and 'PURPOSE'. 
Additionally, I encountered challenges in visualizing the data effectively, especially with numerous categorical variables. To address this, I employed various visualization techniques, including boxplots, scatterplots, and pie charts, to extract meaningful insights. With a more vast dataset, future research objectives could be related to customer segmentation, weather conditions impact, surge pricing and more.
